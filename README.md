# AT3 Randomizer

Item randomizer for Adventure Time: Secret of the Nameless Kingdom. This is not meant to be ran as a script by the end user, this is only meant for Azure Functions.

# Build Instructions

> :warning: **You only need to do this if you're developing the randomizer locally.** If you want to simply randomize your files, use the [Prismo website](https://prismo.at) or the [local script](https://github.com/colinthomas5/AT3-Randomizer) that this is forked from.

Clone the repository, then open the project in Visual Studio Code. Ensure that you have [Azure Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) extension installed on VSCode. Once you get a popup asking to optimize the current project for use with Azure Functions, choose "Yes".
